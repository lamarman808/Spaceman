# Spaceman!
A novelty title for the age-old game, Hang man!

While there is no man hanging, the body should appwar as improper guesses are made!
The Max number of guesses matches the amount of body parts available to reveal.

Like standard Spaceman, the player enters a letter into the input space and clicks the Guess button to enter their guess.
The game compares that entry to the given "string" variable to determine a right or wrong guess. 

Per the button's functionality, EACH guess, right or wrong adds to the bank of general guesses, which lead to a loss after a certain amount are improper.
The solution button yields a failure for the whole game given the bravado of its use.
Otherwise, the player has 6 guesses.
Winning conditions met yields one message in the H1 element made visible, and the same happens with a different message for losses otherwise!

## Next Steps!
1: There shall be a play button and/or a Reset button!
2: Must solidify loss logic for Letter Input!
3: Render the body in sequence!
